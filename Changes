  [DOCUMENTATION]

  - Add a .gitignore file

  - Changelog dates are better written as YYYY.MM.DD and probably ordered in
    the other, descending, direction
    Remark: I have decided to follow the ISO 8601 standard at
    http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime

  - Just use a Makefile.PL and not a Build.PL the latter does not have any
    added value any more

  - In Makefile.PL ==> meta files link to repository
